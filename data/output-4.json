Started with 1/2 (it wasn't this exact pill) and my experience was kinda shitty so I decided to start with 1/4 with this Silver Bar.\n\nMy experience with this pill was good but also very very different. Definitely better than the last time I rolled but not the best roll I've ever had.\n\nIt was a very introspective and kinda selfish/asshole-ish roll and that was unusual for me.\n\nSome weird things happened here that never happened to me before:\n\n- I didn't feel like moving AT ALL. The music playing at the party was great and I loved it but I didn't wanna dance. We sat literally all night. I could tell that my friend was kinda bothered by that (she always wants to dance) but I didn't give a fuck. I just wanted to stay sit. Usually I always do what she wants because I want her to have the best time possible (even if I have to do stuff I don't want to) but this time I didn't care if she was enjoying the roll or not. I didn't even ask her how she was feeling the entire night.\n\n- I didn't feel like talking at all too! I was feeling really amazing tho. Whenever she tried to say something I would only respond with a one word answer or I would just nod. I'm not really a talkative person on E but this time, man, I did not wanna open my mouth to save my life. And we were fine. We weren't on a fight or anything.\n\n- I felt very happy with my body. I have very low self esteem but at some point I was looking at my body (like my legs and arms and face in the mirror) and I was feeling very happy about myself. That was a good feeling.\n\n- I also didn't sweat at all. I always end up dripping in sweat even if i'm not moving that much. I live in the tropicals so it's always hot as fuck here but I didn't sweat at all this time.\n\n- I think I had some mild hallucination. Like, a few times I looked to my side and my friend wasn't there and then I'd blink and there she was. I was also seeing a lot of \"old people\" like bald men but then I'd look again and it's a normal young dude. That was so strange.\n\n- I felt a tiny bit paranoid. For a couple of minute I was absolutely fucking sure the security guard saw us dropping the pill. I didn't say anything to my friend to not worry her but I freaked out for a good 20 minutes until I realized it was nothing.\n\n- That was the worst for me: I felt incredibly anti social! That's not something MDMA does right?\nI felt bothered when some guys would come and sit next to us. Maybe they didn't even wanna to talk to us but I felt so defensive that I held my friend so they would think I'm his boyfriend and leave us alone.\nThe times I went to the bathroom and some guy or girl would approach to try and have a conversation I would just leave them speaking alone. I didn't stop to say I wasn't interested or anything. I just kept walking. That's so fucking rude and that's not me.\n\n- Speaking of that, I also felt repulsed by people making out! What the fuck was that? I was very grossed out by people kissing. Usually that turns me on but not this time. SO weird!\n\nBut overall I think I really enjoyed the experience. The comeup was very smooth and it hit me in like 30 minutes. Redosed another 1/4 around 1 hour later and another redose 1 hour after the first redose.\n\nHonestly I wanted to understand what the fuck happened to me this time. It didn't bother me but it makes me a shitty fucking person to roll with. I'm pretty sure my friend won't be rolling with me anytime soon. I was a bad company and I knew it and I didn't care.\n\n7 other friends and friends of friends also tried this pill the same night at a different party and they all had the time of their lives. They all absolutely fucking loved it. But then again, it was the first time those people tried a decent imported pill. Everything people sell here is utterly shit. I was really happy for them tho.\n\nComedown the next day was kinda rough. Mild depression so I went to the park to take a walk, think a little and smoke a few cigarettes. Returned home and binge watched HBO's Veep and felt a little better.\n\nI don't know tho, I'm in my mid-twenties and I'm starting to feel like I'm getting too old for this, you know.

It was our first time doing a ~200mg pill (we usually take ~120mg pills and we take the whole thing)\n\nLuckily I read a report here and I decided that maybe it was not a good idea to take the whole thing at once and start with half a pill. gf hates the idea but after a lot of convincing she agrees to start with half and THANK GOD WE DID IT!\n\n11:00 pm - We went to a club and had a few beers on a empty stomach. Bad idea, I know. We didn't get drunk though.\n\n1:00 am - Drop half a pill. Stopped drinking alcohol at this point, only water from now on.\n\n1:20 am - gf starts coming up. She's surprised at how fast it was. Usually it takes much longer. She feels like vomiting. A LOT. She sat down for a few minutes and then felt a lot better.\n\n1:40 am - Hell yeah fuck yeah i feel it! Come up was very abrupt.\n\n1:50 am - gf is fucked up, but not really the good kind of fucked up. She's got this really weird look in her face, her eyes are almost completely closed, she's sweating a lot, her face is bloodless and she could barely keep herself standing. People are noticing.\n\n2:00 am - At this point I forgot about myself and how I was feeling and only took care of her. We sat down and I gave her water. She hugged me and asked to tell her some of the good stories we had from the past to try to make her feel a little better. It worked kinda!\n\n3:00 am - She's looking and feeling 70% better and I'm still rolling HARD. I feel like a million dollars. We danced for a while and she insists in taking the other half of the pill. I oppose immediately.\n\n3:30 am - I start coming down and she suggest we take the other half of the pill again. I say we should only take 1/4 since it's late and I was scared she'd feel bad again. We take 1/4 a pill.\n\n4:00 am - She feels amazing and wants to dance. On the other hand I don't feel so good. I'm tired and I really fucking hate the music playing at this club, she loves it tho, so we danced for a while.\n\n5:00 am - We leave the club and head home. My teeth hurts like a motherfucker.\n\n6:00 am - At home now. I need to eat something but I'm not hungry at all. Tried to eat some cake, I chewed it for a good 5 minutes but couldn't swallow it at all and spat it out lol\nWe took a shower and tried to get some sleep. No sex since she's not feeling good and I couldn't get a boner to save my life. It's fine tho. I'm so tired at this point I just wanna sleep.\n\n11:00 am - Woke up feeling alright. No depression or anything of the sort. gf couldn't sleep at all. She took some clonazepam to sleep but it didn't work and she got about 1 hour of sleep. Right now she feels ok but just very tired. We're binge watching Love on netflix cause she loves Judd Apatow and I hope she falls asleep soon cause this show blows lol\n\nSo overall I don't think I had a great experience. I had much better rolls with not so strong pills.\n\nBut then again, of course we shouldn't have drink, especially on a empty stomach! We should've eaten something (when we dropped the pill we hadn't eaten anything for about 6 hours, so that was very dumb) the club we went was terrible, full of shady people and shitty music. The club also was packed and really fucking hot, so I think all those negative points influenced our experience.\n\nAgain, do not take the whole pill if you're inexperienced! This is a very strong pill. I wish I could've tested it but I couldn't find any test kits in my area to buy.\n\nI do recommend this pill but be careful!", "posted_by": "beabod", "date_submitted": "February 21, 2016", "description": "Very strong pill!

At higher doses however the side effects and danger of death are just as severe as those of PMA itself.\n\nPMMA is a lesser-known psychedelic drug. It is the 4-methoxy analogue of methamphetamine. PMMA was probably first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin. In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved), the minimum dosage is listed as 100 mg, and the duration unknown. Shulgin reported that methyl-MA produces an increase in blood pressure and in heart rate, but causes no psychoactive effects, however user reports following the subsequent appearance of this drug on the illicit market as an analogue of \"Ecstasy\" (MDMA) suggest that PMMA does produce some empathogenic effects. Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of PMMA, and given the known toxicity of the related compound PMA it is likely to have considerable potential to cause harmful side effects or overdose which can be fatal.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nNow that this is in the open for all members to view at their will please take this information on board very seriously and I would just like to end this discussion by saying once again PLEASE TEST YOUR PILLS AND INVEST IN A TESTING KIT.\n\nIf you have any further queries please do not hesitate to contact one of the moderators in the Australian section on bluelight.\n\nMy alias identical there feel free to PM me any time you like.

Pills you or friends may think are safe to consume may not be. PMMA/PMA's effects can mimic MDxx substance's effects and to inexperienced and in some cases experienced users convincing them into thinking it contains MDxx resulting in them consuming lethal doses of PMMA/PMA.\n\nOne slip up and it could result in a friend or yourself loosing your life's then being taken to the coroner in a body bag.

They're there to put money in their back pocket and to take it from yours.\n\nOther country's in the world on the other hand may be in a different situation but we live in Australia and the scene has been dying since 2007 onwards. Seasoned users will tell you the same and our MDMA hasn't felt the same since then, We're missing that magical empathetic and euphoric feelings we use to experience with the pills in Australia at this point in time.\n\nWhat was once what we call ecstasy that contained MDMA is rarely no longer circulating our streets of Australia.\n\nWe once again urge you to test your pills before consuming them. Your life isn't worth gambling with over a pill you're about to eat. Think carefully next time you consider consuming anything before it has been tested.\n\nThe following description and link elaborates as to how PMMA/PMA can effect your body. Some of the information may be an early warning sign so please don't hesitate to take yourself to the nearest paramedic or to the nearest possible hospital if you're experiencing any of the early over dose symptoms or effects from this poisonous drug.\n\nIt has an extremely low toxicity rating and it only takes a small dose to reach the lethal effects.\n\nAny information anyone has in regards to this drug please do the right thing and call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.\n\nNever consume pills that give off warning reactions with the reagents colour chart.

PMA and PMMA are nearly identical in chemical make-up, and their effects on the body are essentially the same. For the purpose of this entry, PMA and PMMA will be discussed as one.\n\nPMA is a synthetic hallucinogen, meaning that it is made in a laboratory and is a mind-altering drug. Derived from the Latin word allucinari, which means \"to wander in the mind,\" hallucinogenic drugs alter the user's perception of reality, thought, or emotion, and can result in alternate states of consciousness or hallucinations, visions or other perceptions of things that are not really present.. PMA was known to have been used for a short time in the early 1970s in the United States and Canada and saw a comeback in the 1990s.\n\nPMA is often sold as another synthetic hallucinogen called ecstasy (MDMA). Illegal drug makers often pass off PMA for ecstasy for several reasons: 1) Ecstasy is a popular party drug among teenagers and young adults; 2) PMA is cheaper to produce than ecstasy; and 3) PMA is similar in appearance, cost, and effect. However, PMA is far more dangerous than ecstasy. Its initial slow effect on the body sometimes causes users to take more of the drug because they think they have taken weak ecstasy. More drug can lead to overdose.\n\nOfficial Drug Name: Paramethoxyamphetamine (PAH-ruh-meth-AHK-see-am-FETT-uh-meen) p-methoxyamphetamine, 4-methoxyamphetamine (all names for PMA); paramethoxymethamphetamine (PAH-ruh-meth-AHK-see-METH-am-fett-uh-meen; PMMA)\n\nCombining PMA with other drugs, alcohol, or caffeine increases the risk of overdose. Those who have ingested PMA have reported breathing difficulties, nausea, vomiting, muscle spasms, and increased blood pressure and temperature. Those suffering from PMA overdose experience high body temperatures, sometimes resulting in convulsions, coma, and a complete shut down of the organs of the body. This fact has led to the drug's street name \"death.\" Since PMA is sometimes sold as ecstasy, unsuspecting users are unprepared for the potential side effects of the more deadly drug.\n\nhttp://www.enotes.com/drugs-substances-encyclopedia/pma-pmma\n__________________________________________________\n\nhttp://www.bluelight.ru/vb/archive/index.php/t-663792.html\n\nWe strongly recommend members take the time to read through the material and links provided in the links above and below for the safety of yourself and friends of yours.

In the year 2000 I was dealing the almighty white Mitsubishi's by the straw. I got caught selling to an undercover cop for a few months. The report from the fed lab came back as positive for MDMA and at least 100 mg per pill. After I got caught I stopped selling but continued using from time to time. So I must say that I do know my pills pretty well. \n\nOK, so finding E here in Guatemala is pretty hard considering that you have a lot of idiots trying to sell other crap as ecstasy. The last time I used was 3 years ago here in Guatemala. I did my usual research on the pills before I bought them. I had the red dolphins that were pretty damn good. So now I come across these green cK's and think damn, I have to try these. \n\nI buy 3 of them for me and my girlfriend. This will be her first time rolling. Friday night:\n11:15 PM we pop the first one with some water and a small vodka and OJ on empty stomachs. I usually start to feel the pills pretty quickly in comparison to others. We start to play cards and listen to music.\n11:30 PM I start to get bowel movements which I know is an indicator. My girl says she feels just a little upset stomach. \n11:40 PM I'm starting to roll and don't want to play cards anymore. now I want to listen to music and start to get a little chatty with my girl. She says she feels it a little. \n12 AM I'm rolling and my girl finally starts to get hit hard, she tells me she can't stop clenching her jaw so I get some blow pops and start eating them. She eats through her blow pop like crazy and starts biting on the plastic stick from the blow pop. I tell her to try to control it but she cant. I'm keeping my jaw clenching to a minimum but it gets kind of hard. \n12:40 PM all kinds of eye wiggles and euphoric, warm and tingly good feelings, we're both dancing and singing to songs like crazy. We hit the bong a couple times and drink some ice water and cold OJ. We're hammered by now!! Our vision and hearing gets heightened. brings back memories. \n2 AM Still feeling really light and feel like time is going by really slow. We decide to cut the other pill in half and pop a half each. \n2:15 rolling hard again and listening to music and eating grapes. wasn't hard at all to swallow. Grapes were pretty damn good.\n2:45 AM We start to get horny. We foreplay and make love for about 3 hours on the couch in the living room. After that we go to the bedroom and have sex for another hour. Man the sex was amazing!! That's all I'm gonna say. \n7 AM we fall asleep with that spacey feeling. Go to sleep like babies. I woke up at 12 PM to use the bathroom and went back to sleep like nothing and we got up at 2 PM. I find out my girlfriend broke her tooth while chewing on the blow pop stick!! A piece of her front tooth was missing!!! We'll get it fixed. \n2:30 PM I make a late breakfast and we have no problem eating it all up. We were hungry ass shit!! We also eat a banana and some OJ. We still feel the pill on and off at times, especially when we smoke weed. Feels good though..... We don't have any depression or scattered feelings. \nI must say these pills are as pure and legit as possible. Good MDMA. It's been a long time since I had some good pills like these and hardly any bad side effects other than the jaw clenching for my girl. But hey it was her first time and I warned her about biting down too hard but you know once you're rolling, no one can stop you if it feels good!!

Start dancing, I feel like i'm walking on water, I take my heart-rate and is noticeably over 100bpm.\n\n0025: i accompany her to get her a vodka/lemonade, and I feel completely mullered and nauseous which is common for me, not a peak, just disorientated, and a partygoer starts rubbing my back; she obviousy saw all the water bottles and ridiculously colourful rave paraphenalia- feels amazing.\n\n0030: We keep dancing, and i feel completely sober, I thought that, that was it.\n\n0040: Oh no. It hits me like a bulldozer the second some guy asked me if i was waiting in the queue, i could not reply, and just moved out of the way, people everywhere were rushing about and had INTENSE visuals, she gets another drink, and im socialising and dancing extravagantly, as people would say; rolling balls, could not see straight to save my life.\n\n0100: My dropping partner lost her ticket to buy her drink, i was very empathenogenic towards her (i rarely feel any empathy) I have never felt so happy and sad at the time. My eyes wiggling and wobbling so much, i just didn't bother opening them and let them roll inside their sockets as i was dancing euphorically.\n\n0100-0230: A fucking blur, I was in wonderland, dancing and making out with my dropping partner, that's all.\n\n0245: Still dancing, but more sober.\n\n0300: Feel really hungry!!! I'm coming down a bit, tempted to eat my other pill.\n\n0315: Still high, gave into temptation, tried to split my other pill on the dancefloor, too hard, bit off about 2/3 and ate it, gave the rest to my dropping partner. It was partly in attempt to supress my appetite: I was THAT hungry.\n\n0330: Don't know where the fuck I am, dancing lunactically, sweating like a flu-patient, coming down and coming up simultaneously, which made me feel a bit giddy.\n\n0345: Dancing with friends and singing along with no embarassment, hit a second peak.\n\n0345-0440: BLUR!\n\n0445: Came down suddenly, hungry and tired a hell.\n\n0500: My dropping partner is fucked, she had several vodkas throughout the night. I take her home, and I feel exhausted.\n\n0530: Arrive home, she was talking absolute codshit to the cabbie. I eat a bit of chocolate and some mozzarella. Feel exhausted, and head hurts, but starving.\n\n0600-0800: Feeling like shit, but have several vodka/lemonades. \n\n0800-1200: Spent it with my dropping partner, having sex every-so-often and falling in and out of consciousness.\n\n1200-1400: Trying to piece together the night, and wrote this report...\n\nWas a lovely pill, rolling like an idiot, but had terrible bruxism, went through a pack of gum and my dropping partner who is a non-smoker, went through a pack of menthols, and now am eating pasta, since my jaw and molars hurt so much. I feel shattered, so now im going to rinse some unhealthy food in front of the box.\n\n\n1400-1800: Knackered, on facebook all afternoon telling fellow ecstasy-takers how good my night was and to come to Chile, watching clips on youtube. Watching sitcoms, but could not interpret any of the dialogue, just watching the moving images. I feel hungover, but i can usually associate it with sleep deprivation, so am uncertain if it was a state of E-tardedness. But I was in a good mood all day.\n\n1800-1900: Fell asleep on my dropping partner's lap whilst watching Grease, a friend woke me up asking for a cigarette, and I was drenched in sweat, even though a big fan was blasting at me, possibly a result of my body expelling free-radicals?\n\nPills here just keep getting better and better; but it makes me think that this could have been an old-school pill, because I haven't managed to find any similarities between this one in any other reports. I would like to know where it was made...\n\n9.5/10 The gurning made it lose half a mark, cleanest, and most fun pill i've ever had. My dropping partner did pills weekly for 18 months back in Brazil, and she said that this pill was better than her first time, even with the antagonising effect of all the booze. I have had mdma 6 times and this was the 15th time that I have done pills... just for some perspective.\n\n\nPLUR", "posted_by": "partybeast", "date_submitted": "December 19, 2009", "description": "Yet again sorry for no picture, i ate my spare, lol, it weighed 250 mgs, horrendously strong mdma taste, and as clean as a whistle.", "last_update": "December 20, 2009", "logo": "None", "colour": "Lime green with black speckles", "shape": "Round, slightly domed", "height": "4.0 mm", "width": "10.0 mm", "texture": "Hard, very well-pressed, smooth", "edges": "Sharp", "suspected_contents": "MDMA", "rating": "MDxx High", "warning": "No", "tested": "No", "consumed": "Yes", "region": 4}, {"id": "19820", "name": "Rolex Roja Red Rolex", "location": "buenos aires argentina", "image": "images/fullsize/19820.jpg", "user_report": "I took first half a pill to check it.\nIt was aproved for an entire pill experience.

Ever.\n\nThe pill is bigger than usual. Even so, I don't really know how it could hold something so strong and powerful in it.\n\nI used to take a half, wait 30 minutes and take the other half. Then, 45 mins after that, without noticing any major mood change so far, you'll feel something coming.. It's like a bomb drop, leading that whistle sound effect. You'll feel it coming as this whistle feeling gets harder, and when you less expect, the \"bomb\" hits you! O-M-G !!!\n\nDo you know the meaning of the word FUCKED? Well.. You'll have to find a better one to describe this. It's kind of you can't tell where you are, who you are, what's happening, you can't even tell if you're alive at this point!! Can't focus in anything, like there are fireworks in your head, there's these explosions happening all the time. Everything you look is messed. You can't walk, cause you can't see a damm thing in front of you. Colours, objects, people.. are all mixed. It's like Disneyland for the very first time. You feel like falling, flying, jumping, zero gravity, bungee, all at the same time. In every 3 sec or so, it's like a rocket kicks in and you just can't concentrate in anything, so don't even try to talk, it's a waste of time. After an hour or two, you'll be able to speak again. I'm not saying you can make a normal sentence, but you'll be able to speak your name or so. Also, you'll start to be capable of control what you feel. It means that if you want to dance all night, you can do it. If you feel like chilling out and enjoying the feeling, you'll be pleased as well. This moment is very special, you can focus in each sense at a time: taste, taction, olfaction, hearing... Whatever you want.\n\nVery slowly these effects will come down. First the tunnel vision, then the hot colors, then the vivid dreams... You'll still be feeling well, tho. About half an hour later, you'll start feeling sleepy and a little tired. You might feel a little down at this time, but you should be able to sleep well. The next day won't feel like christmas, but you'll probably still trying to figure out what happened yesterday. The day after that, however, should be a lot better, and within the week you'll recover completely.\n\nI share many people statements when I say that I never tried anything, really anything, that could be near close to this.

Comparando los efectos que percib\u00ed en varios ensayos con los tiburones creo que tengo que aceptar que com\u00ed una piperazina, aparentemente \"meta-chlorophenylpiperazine\" conocida como M-CCP.\nEn la foto pueden ver el tama\u00f1o de la pastilla en relaci\u00f3n a un encendedor bic (de los grandes).", "last_update": "December 2, 2006", "logo": "Shark - Tiburon", "colour": "White (Blanco)", "shape": "Round", "texture": "Se desgrana facilmente", "suspected_contents": "Piperazine", "rating": "Adulterated", "warning": "Yes", "tested": "No", "consumed": "Yes", "region": 4}, {"id": "3656", "name": "D & G (Dolce And Gabbana)", "location": "Suriname", "image": "images/fullsize/3656.jpg", "user_report": "I took 2 of those with a 1.5 hour window. The first one didn\\'t do anything significant with me. You feel just a little but no thrill. Then the 2nd one, that one realy pushed my button. I felt the love, felt the body rush and had only a little jaw flapping. The jaw flapping appeard after the rush. \n\nBecause of the jaw flapping and a little oppressed love feeling i think there might be a little speed involved. but when you don\\'t have that in a pill?\n\nYou know that echo in your ear when you talk? i had that for a few minutes. Also a little.\n\nFor your information: i did not use mdma (powder it was) since november 2005 and have done pills in my life about 10 times tops. \n\nConclusion: if you are in Suriname and want to feel the xtc love and find this one, you go for it. Don\\'t forget to buy 2, one is 100% not enough.

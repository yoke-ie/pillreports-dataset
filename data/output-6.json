My partner and I took one each at 1:17 am. The taste was mild, for an ecstasy pill. I was able to keep it on my tongue without the urge to retch.\n\nWe started coming up some 20 - 30 minutes later. Unfortunately, there isn't much more to add - the experience as a whole can best be described as 'mild'. There was no nausea coming up, there was very minimal jaw clenching, and we never really peaked. The experience was pleasant but that's about it.\n\nIt felt like an extremely low dose to the both of us.\n\nFor reference, these pills were bought in Karachi some three months ago, supposedly imported from the Netherlands. I am aware that there is some speculation about second/first press and deteriorating quality, but I don't know enough to be able to tell what press this is. It is possible that it's a counterfeit. Either way, after three mediocre experiences in a row, my partner and I are a bit skeptical of the Dutch 'super pills', or at least the ones that are making it to Pakistan under that guise.\n\nETA: I'd like to point out for those that might be interested that ALL the effects of the pill seemed to be muted. Energy, euphoria, etc. were low, but so too were the nausea (nonexistent), jaw-clenching (extremely mild), and comedown (also very mild).\n\nThis, coupled with the fact that both my partner and I had waited 3 months before rolling causes us to believe that the pill was low on active ingredients.", "posted_by": "beatsurfer", "date_submitted": "November 8, 2014", "description": "Hard, well-pressed, gently rounded edges.", "last_update": "November 9, 2014", "logo": "GOLD on one side, 199.9 mg on the other.", "colour": "Dull Yellow", "shape": "Rectangular", "suspected_contents": "MDMA", "rating": "MDxx Low", "warning": "No", "tested": "No", "consumed": "Yes", "region": 6}, {"id": "34008", "name": "White Bugatti", "location": "islamabad", "image": "images/fullsize/34008.jpg", "user_report": "so . with my boys at an apartment . waiting for these boys to come . they came :P \nso . 10:00 popped first half\n11:00 start to come up . feeling the rush and heat inside me. \n11:30 at peak , thought about popping the next half . popped \n12:30 at high peak . good euphoria , massive eye wobbling. feeling light as a feather .\n1:30 the effects start to come off . the peak was very very small .did'nt expected it to be a small roll . \n2.30 dancing and smoking joints, chit chatting with friends . \n3:30 the pill has almost worn off. 4.00 feeling tired so went to sleep . \nnot a good roll i expected as i heard there are of high mdxx but felt like low mdma in it and other cuts(speed) etc . \noverall the pill was clean , i was able to eat good .", "posted_by": "farehe", "date_submitted": "October 22, 2014", "description": "heard about this boyes . needed to try it", "logo": "Bugatti", "colour": "White", "shape": "Oval", "texture": "Smooth", "edges": "Smooth", "suspected_contents": "MDxx", "rating": "MDxx High", "warning": "No", "tested": "No", "consumed": "Yes", "region": 6}, {"id": "33994", "name": "Pink Superman", "location": "Islamabad", "image": "images/fullsize/33994.jpg", "user_report": "8pm: Decorated the whole room for my friends and popped about 3quarters .

I couldn't smoke anymore cigarettes as it tasted disgusting. \n\nI then lied down in my bed, but couldn't sleep. My body now felt very uncomfortable, difficult to describe. I just knew, there was a lot of bad stuff in that pill. I got worried, felt my pulse and checked my body temperature, but both were fine (so I assume no PMA). I felt like shit, depressed, worried, annoyed. \n\n03:30 - I started having some hallucinogenic effects, similar to a low dose 2c-b. That's when I knew: I'm not gonna sleep for a long while. Eventually tried to do some autogenic training to relax my body, which helped a bit, but then started having acoustic hallucinations (which was interesting but not fun that moment). \n\nSomehow I managed spending the night lying awake in bed. It was NO fun experience.

She gave me a back massage and I had a \u201cconversation with God\u201d (the first time that ever happened) and felt that all is right in the world. We continued to hug and kiss and then I went down on her for about an hour. There were some closed-eye visuals and lots of eye wiggles while looking at the iTunes visualizer.
